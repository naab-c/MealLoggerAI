# MealLoggerAI
Meal Logger AI saves meal entries into a shared Google Sheet, where each approved user has their own dedicated tab. This makes it easy for groups (families, teams, or nutrition coaches) to track meals together in a single spreadsheet. Only the extension owner can grant access by adding users, and no data is shared outside of this shared sheet.
