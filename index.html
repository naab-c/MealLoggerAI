  <h1>Privacy Policy â€“ Meal Logger AI</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Meal Logger AI allows users to enter information about meals they have eaten.
    - <strong>Meal Data:</strong> Text descriptions of foods (e.g., "2 boiled eggs, 1 cup yogurt").
    - <strong>User Settings:</strong> Email and username stored locally in Chrome storage to map the user to their dedicated tab in the shared Google Sheet.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    Your meal data is used only for:
    <ul>
      <li>Providing nutrition analysis (calories, protein, carbs, fats) via the OpenAI API.</li>
      <li>Saving entries into a shared Google Sheet where each approved user has their own tab.</li>
    </ul>
    No other use of your information is made.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or share your data with third parties. Data is only transmitted securely to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Apps Script backend:</strong> used as a proxy to relay requests (due to CORS restrictions).</li>
      <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> to generate nutrient breakdowns.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Sheets:</strong> to store logged meals in a shared spreadsheet managed by the sheet owner.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>
    - All communication is encrypted with HTTPS.<br>
    - Only the sheet owner and approved users have access to the shared sheet.<br>
    - Data is never used beyond the stated purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    - Users can stop using the extension at any time.<br>
    - Users can request removal from the shared Google Sheet by contacting the sheet owner.<br>
    - No other personal or sensitive data is collected or stored.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Remote Code</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does not download or execute remote code. It only makes secure HTTPS requests to the proxy backend (Google Apps Script) to relay meal data to the OpenAI API.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
