# MealLoggerAI
Meal Logger AI is a browser extension that helps users log meals into a shared Google Sheet and instantly see an AI generated nutritional breakdown including calories, protein, carbs, and fat. Each approved user gets their own dedicated tab to track meals over time. All data is stored only in the shared Google Sheet and is not shared externally.
